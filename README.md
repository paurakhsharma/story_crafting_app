# Story Crafting App

An app to assist in the development of oral Bible story recordings.

## Getting Started
The app can be run in local mode simply by running `flutter run`. This uses fake data and does not require integration with firebase.

To execute the app with firebase integration, setup the required files and then run `flutter run lib/main_prod.dart`.

Tests can be run by executing `flutter test`.
